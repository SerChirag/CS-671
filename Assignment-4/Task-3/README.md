### Results
results/results.txt contains output produced by our network.
Epochs vs Loss graph is also present in /results/

# Requirements
Make sure 'train.py' and 'test.py' are in root folder containing 'pap.txt'
Make a directory named 'results' which will store results after training

### Execution
Step1: Run 'python train.py'
Step2: Run 'python test.py' to test results

If you wish to change seed sentances, edit test.py


### Reference: 
Code has been motivated from: https://medium.com/@david.campion/text-generation-using-bidirectional-lstm-and-doc2vec-models-1-3-8979eb65cb3a

We tuned hyper-parameters and edited code to fit our problem well.
